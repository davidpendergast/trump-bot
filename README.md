# trump-bot

Generates interesting messages using Markov chains based off of Donald Trump's actual tweets. See the bot in action here: [TrumpoTron5000](https://twitter.com/TrumpoTron5000 "TrumpoTron5000")

The code here only generates the tweet text. Actual tweeting is automated via the very cool framework built by Zach Whelan: [link here](http://www.zachwhalen.net/posts/how-to-make-a-twitter-bot-with-google-spreadsheets-version-04/ "How to make a Twitter Bot with Google Spreadsheets")

Trump's archived tweets were downloaded from [Trump Twitter Archive](http://www.trumptwitterarchive.com/#/ "Trump Twitter Archive")
